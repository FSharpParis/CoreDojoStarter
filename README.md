This is a starter project to use in F# coding dojos.

It relies on .NET core and references Expecto as a testing library/runner.

Just clone the repo or download it, and get started coding and testing in F#!

To get started, just dotnet run in the folder. The executable will run Expecto tests. One of the 2 tests is a failing one. Your first task could be to fix it :)
